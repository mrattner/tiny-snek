# Tiny Snek

Named in honor of [Tiny Snek Comics](https://www.instagram.com/tinysnekcomics/) by Alex Cohen and made using [cookiecutter](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html), this is a template for small (cute) Python projects.

## Using the template

You must have CookieCutter installed.

Provide the URL to the Git repository to create a templated project in the current directory:

        $ cookiecutter gh:mrattner/tiny-snek

Follow the prompts, or press `ENTER` to accept the default values.

## Known issues

This template is not compatible with Windows because it uses the pipe character `|` in a directory name.
